# React TypeScript Todo App

## About this Repository

This app was created during the React TypeScript Todo App tutorial (link forthcoming). I recommend following along with the tutorial video, but feel free to clone this app directly and explore the code!

## Run the App

Install dependencies:

```bash
yarn
```

Run the app:

```
yarn start
```

## Notes

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
